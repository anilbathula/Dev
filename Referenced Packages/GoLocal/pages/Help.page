				<p>GoLocal helps you keep in touch with leads and contacts located in remote states and even countries. GoLocal takes care of calculating local time differences for you, and helps you keep focused on what’s really important - your customers and prospects.</p>
				<p>While the GoLocal Engine runs in the background to automatically identify locations and time zones for leads, contacts, and accounts in your Salesforce org, you can use the following components to plan your day and to reach your leads and contacts in time:</p>
				<p><a href="help?t=widget"><b>Local Time Widget</b></a> - displays the current location and local time for leads, contacts, accounts, opportunities, cases, and tasks; and the local start and end times for events.</p>
				<p><a href="help?t=agenda"><b>Agenda Tab</b></a> - lists your open tasks ordered by the local time at the related lead’s or contact’s location, so you know when the right time to make the call is.</p>
				<p><a href="help?t=hitlist"><b>Hit-List Tab</b></a> - lists leads from a selected view (or a set of pre-selected leads) ordered by the local time at each lead’s location, so you know when each of them is available and is ready to talk.</p>
				<p><a href="help?t=scheduler"><b>GoLocal Scheduler</b></a> - lets you schedule events with leads and contacts using your local time or theirs, updating in real-time, so you and your party always know exactly when the meeting is going to take place.</p>
				<p><br/>Please Note: Some of GoLocal’s features must be enabled by your Salesforce administrator.</p>

				<p>The Agenda tab within the GoLocal app helps you plan your day when you need to contact multiple leads and contacts which are distributed across different states and even countries.</p>
				<p>The Agenda tab displays your open tasks sorted by the related lead’s or contact’s local time, so it’s always easy to see which leads or contacts can be reached now, or when it’s better to try reaching them later.</p> 
				<img src="{!URLFOR($Resource.GoLocalRes, 'Help/Img/agenda.png')}" />
				<p>Use the filter pick-list to display limited sets of tasks based on due dates, for example you can show only overdue task, or only tasks that are scheduled for today. Use the Refresh link to update the Local Time column and other information in the table.</p>
				<img src="{!URLFOR($Resource.GoLocalRes, 'Help/Img/agenda_filter.png')}" />
				<p><br/><b>Mini Agenda</b></p>
				<p>The Mini Agenda homepage component displays a minified agenda view on your homepage, showing 10 tasks per page as a preview of your daily tasks right when you log into Salesforce.</p>

				<p>The GoLocal Hit-List is a great way to select the leads you want to reach out to during the day. The Hit-List tab displays leads from a given leads view (similar to the leads tab) sorted by the lead’s current local time, so it’s easy to see right away which leads are ready to talk now, and which are probably away.</p> 
				<img src="{!URLFOR($Resource.GoLocalRes, 'Help/Img/hit_list.png')}" />
				<p>Use the View pick-list to show leads from a specific view, and the Refresh link to update the Local Time column and other information in the table.</p>
				<img src="{!URLFOR($Resource.GoLocalRes, 'Help/Img/hit_list_filter.png')}" />
				<p><br/>Please Note: The Hit-List tab will display up to 500 leads for a given view. We recommend that you create views that contain up to 250 leads at a time for optimal performance.</p>
				<p><br/><b>Custom Hit-Lists</b></p>
				<p>While the Hit-List tab shows all of the leads from a specific leads view, you can also create a Hit-List to display only a set of selected leads (great when you have specific leads that you wish to contact during the day).</p> 
				<p>To create a custom Hit-List, open the desired view in the leads tab, select the desired leads and click the Create Hit-List button. The newly created Hit-List will contain only the leads selected. Use the Refresh link to update the information in the table during the day.</p>
				<img src="{!URLFOR($Resource.GoLocalRes, 'Help/Img/custom_hit_list.png')}" />
				<p><br/><b>Mini Hit-List</b></p>
				<p>The Mini Hit-List homepage component displays a minified Hit-List view on your homepage, showing 10 leads per page as a preview of your leads right when you log into Salesforce.</p>

			<div class="content">
			    <p><a href="help">&lt;&lt; Go to Help home</a></p>
			    <p>The GoLocal Widget displays the location (flag, country code, and state code if applicable) and the current local time at that location for each lead, contact and account.</p>
			    <img src="{!URLFOR($Resource.GoLocalRes, 'Help/Img/widget_lead.png')}" />
			    <p>On tasks, cases and opportunities GoLocal will display the associated lead’s, contact’s or account’s location and local time respectively.</p>
			    <img src="{!URLFOR($Resource.GoLocalRes, 'Help/Img/widget_case.png')}" />
			    <p>On calendar events, GoLocal will display the local start and end times for the associated lead or contact, so it’s always easy to communicate the exact meeting time to your prospects and customers in their local time zone.</p>

				<p><br/>Tip: use the <a href="help?t=scheduler">GoLocal Scheduler</a> to schedule events with your leads and contacts using their local time zone.</p>
			</div>
		</apex:outputPanel>

		<apex:outputPanel layout="block" rendered="{!$CurrentPage.parameters.t='scheduler'}">
			<div class="header">
				<div>GoLocal On-Line Help</div>
				<div class="topic">Scheduler</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="content">
			    <p><a href="help">&lt;&lt; Go to Help home</a></p>
				<p>Use the GoLocal Scheduler to schedule events with remote leads and contacts using their local time zone.</p> 
				<p>The GoLocal Scheduler can be invoked from the Scheduler tab,</p>
				<img src="{!URLFOR($Resource.GoLocalRes, 'Help/Img/scheduler_tab.png')}" />
				<p>or by clicking the New GoLocal Event button in the Open Activities related list on leads, contacts, accounts, opportunities and cases.</p>
				<img src="{!URLFOR($Resource.GoLocalRes, 'Help/Img/scheduler_button.png')}" />
				<p>When you schedule an event with the GoLocal Scheduler, fill in the event details and description like in a standard Salesforce event page then use the Parties &amp; Schedule section to specify the event start and end times.</p> 
				<img src="{!URLFOR($Resource.GoLocalRes, 'Help/Img/scheduler.png')}" />
				<p>The left side of the Parties &amp; Schedule section shows the event time in the event owner’s time zone while the right side shows the event time in the related lead’s or contact’s time zone. When one of the date or time fields changes, the respective field for the other party will be updated as well to reflect event local time for both parties.</p>
				<p><br/>Scheduler Tips:</p>
				<p>When changing a date field, use the Ctrl and arrow keys to quickly navigate across the calendar, and the Enter key to select a date.</p>
				<p>On time fields you can use the Up/Down keys to quickly add/subtract 30 minutes to the selected time value.</p>
				<p>While the time fields display the time in your locale, values in both 12 and 24 hour formats are accepted. For example, you can manually enter 4:30 PM or 16:30 and the value be automatically translated to display in the right format.</p>
				<p>You can specify a different event owner in the Assigned To field when scheduling an event for somebody else, the time on the left side will then display in their time zone.</p>
				<p>When entering values in the lookup fields (Related To, Assigned To, and Name) you can enter a partial value and press Enter to see a list of matching options.</p>
				<p>If you wish to edit an existing event, use the Edit with GoLocal button on the event’s page.</p>
